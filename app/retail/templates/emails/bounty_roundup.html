            </p>
            <p>
                I am happy to say that over 2/3 of the <a href="https://media.consensys.net/gitcoin-joins-consensys-announces-pilot-projects-f5a0955de9d6">pilot project issues</a> have been claimed or fulfilled.  Once the remaining issues are claimed, we will be writing a blog post about what we've learned, but it sure is promising to see the progress so far!

                The big news this week is that Gitcoin is offering ETH bonuses for referrals to bounties.  The recruiter bonus bounties are worth 15% of the value of the original bounty.
            </p>
            <p>
                It's my dream to put linkedin recruiters out of business by building a p2p developer-centric recruitment community. p2p recruitment mesh network == more credibility, WAY less spam.üíØ
